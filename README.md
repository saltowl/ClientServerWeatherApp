## What is it?

This client-server application displays the weather at the current location when allowing access to the location. If you deny access to your current location, this application displays the weather in St. Petersburg. You can also add cities to your favorites and monitor the weather in them even after reloading the page thanks to the use of mongodb.

Instructions for use are in the appropriate folders.

Start the server before starting the client.
